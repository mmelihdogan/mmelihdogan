### Hey There <a href="https://www.melihd.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif"  width="25px"></a>
I’m Melih, fresh graduate from Management Information Systems at Boğaziçi University. I'm a strong team player who is able to quickly learn from his fellows and seniors.

My path with coding crossed first when I was a freshman but I did not delve into it back then. Afterwards, I had the opportunity of attending front-end web development bootcamp in 2020. In 5-months-long intensive training focusing on JS and React, I also participated various team and solo projects. Then I took a break for a while but I didn't idle around afterward, of course. While I was exploring the start-up and entrepreneurship ecosystem in Turkey during my project assistant time in Yıldız Technopark, I took courses in various fields such as security, cloud computing, and mobile application development at the college.
